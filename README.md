Red Hat Cloud HR Onboarding Assets Demo 
=======================================
This demo is to install JBoss BPM Suite in the Cloud based on leveraging any Red Hat OpenShift container based platform such as:

 - [Red Hat Container Platform (OCP)](https://github.com/redhatdemocentral/ocp-install-demo)
  
It delivers a fully functioning JBoss BPM Suite process project for HR onboarding new employee asset management.


Install Cloud HR Onboarding Asset Demo on OpenShift
---------------------------------------------------
1. First ensure you have an OpenShift container based installation, such as one of the followling installed first:

  - [OCP Install Demo](https://github.com/redhatdemocentral/ocp-install-demo)

  - or your own OpenShift installation.

2. [Download and unzip this demo.](https://github.com/eschabell/rhcs-hronboarding-assets-demo/archive/master.zip)

3. Add products to installs directory.

4. Run 'init.sh':
```
   # The installation needs to be pointed to a running version
   # of OpenShift, so pass an IP address such as:
   #
   $ ./init.sh 192.168.99.100  # example for OCP.
```

Now log in to JBoss BPM Suite to start exploring containerized HR onboaring new employee assets project (the address will be generated by the init script):

  - OCP example: http://rhcs-hronboarding-demo-appdev-in-cloud.192.168.99.100.nip.io/business-central ( u:erics / p:bpmsuite1! )


Notes
-----
This project can be installed on any OpenShift platform, such as OpenShift Container Platform or Red Hat Container Development Kit.
It's possible to install it on any available installation by pointing this installer to an OpenShift IP address:
```
  $ ./init.sh IP
```

If for any reason the installation breaks or you want a new JBoss BRMS installation, just remove the project rhcs-bpms-install-demo
entry in the OpenShift console and re-run the installation.

To clone a repository in the running container, the following actions would need to occur from a developer's machine.

1. Execute port forwarding through the OpenShift CLI. This will open a tunnel between the developer's machine and the pod through
	 the OpenShift API pod proxy. The command window will block while the session is open:

   ```
   # Read-only access to repo on port 9418.
   #
   $ oc port-forward $(oc get pod -l=deploymentconfig=rhcs-hronboarding-demo --template='{{ range .items }} {{ .metadata.name }} {{ end }}') 9418:9418

   # Read-write access to repo on port 8001.
   #
   $ oc port-forward $(oc get pod -l=deploymentconfig=rhcs-hronboarding-demo --template='{{ range .items }} {{ .metadata.name }} {{ end }}') 8001:8001
   ```

2. Clone the repository. In another window, clone the remote repository:

   ```
   # Read-only access to repo on port 9418.
   #
   $ git clone git://localhost:9418/hronboarding

   # Read-write access to repo on port 8001.
   #
   $ git clone git://localhost:8001/hronboarding
   ```
